## Sass

We can use Sass, a stylesheet preprocessor to help us maintain large and complex css files.

#### Setup from command line

Install Sass using npm by running:
```
npm install -g sass
```
then you'll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass and .scss files to .css files. For example:
```
sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css
```
Link the new generated css file from the build folder in your index.html file.

Here is the [original documentation](https://sass-lang.com/install) for more information.
