# Various and Common Used Commands for Git-Github 

### First what is Git ? 
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

### A little bit about the glossary
### Branch  
Branches represent specific versions of a repository that “branch out” from your main project. Branches allow you to keep track of experimental changes you make to repositories and revert to older versions.

### Commit 
A commit represents a specific point in your project’s history. Use the commit command in conjunction with the git add command to let git know which changes you wish to save to the local repository. Note that commits are not automatically sent to the remote server.

### Checkout 
Use the git checkout command to switch between branches. Just enter git checkout followed by the name of the branch you wish to move to, or enter git checkout master to return to the master branch. Mind your commits as you switch between branches.

### Fetch 
The git fetch command copies and downloads all of a branch’s files to your device. Use it to save the latest changes to your repositories. It’s possible to fetch multiple branches simultaneously.

### Fork 
A fork is a copy of a repository. Take advantage of “forking” to experiment with changes without affecting your main project.

### Head 
The commit at the tip of a branch is called the head. It represents the most current commit of the repository you’re currently working in.

### Index 
Whenever you add, delete or alter a file, it remains in the index until you are ready to commit the changes. Think of it as the staging area for Git. Use the git status command to see the contents of your index. Changes highlighted in green are ready to be committed while those in red still need to be added to staging.

### Master 
The master is the primary branch of all your repositories. It should include the most recent changes and commits.

### Merge 
Use the git merge command in conjunction with pull requests to add changes from one branch to another.

### Origin 
The origin refers to the default version of a repository. Origin also serves as a system alias for communicating with the master branch. Use the command git push origin master to push local changes to the master branch.

### Pull 
Pull requests represent suggestions for changes to the master branch. If you’re working with a team, you can create pull requests to tell the repository maintainer to review the changes and merge them upstream. The git pull command is used to add changes to the master branch.

### Push 
The git push command is used to update remote branches with the latest changes you’ve committed.

### Rebase 
The git rebase command lets you split, move or get rid of commits. It can also be used to combine two divergent branches.

### Remote 
A remote is a clone of a branch. Remotes communicate upstream with their origin branch and other remotes within the repository.

### Repository 
Git repositories hold all of your project’s files including branches, tags and commits.

### Stash 
The git stash command removes changes from your index and “stashes” them away for later. It’s useful if you wish to pause what you’re doing and work on something else for a while. You can’t stash more than one set of changes at a time.

### Tags 
Tags provide a way to keep track of important commits. Lightweight tags simply serve as pointers while annotated tags get stored as full objects.

### Upstream 
In the context of Git, upstream refers to where you push your changes, which is typically the master branch.

### The Commands 
### Configuring Git
- Set the username:

        git config –global user.name
- Set the user email:

        git config –global user.email
- Create a Git command shortcut:

        git config –global alias.
- Set the preferred text editor:

        git config –system core.editor
- Open and edit the global configuration file in the text editor:

        git config –global –edit

### Setting Up Git Repositories
- Create an empty repository in the    project folder:

        git init
- Clone a repository from GitHub and add it to the project folder:

        git clone (repo URL)
- Clone a repository to a specific folder:

        git clone (repo URL) (folder)
- Display a list of remote repositories with URLs:

        git remote -v
- Remove a remote repository:

        git remote rm (remote repo name)
- Retrieve the most recent changes from origin but don’t merge:

        git fetch
- Retrieve the most recent changes from origin and merge:

        git pull
### Managing File Changes
- Add file changes to staging:

        git add (file name)
- Add all directory changes to staging:

        git add .
- Add new and modified files to staging:

        git add -A
- Remove a file and stop tracking it:

        git rm (file_name)
- Untrack the current file:

        git rm –cached (file_name)
- Recover a deleted file and prepare it for commit:

        git checkout <deleted file name>
- Display the status of modified files:

        git status
- Display a list of ignored files:

        git ls-files –other –ignored –exclude-standard
- Display all unstaged changes in the index and the current directory:

        git diff
- Display differences between files in staging and the most recent versions:

        git diff –staged
- Display changes in a file compared to the most recent commit:

        git diff (file_name)
### Git Commits
- Commit changes along with a custom message:

        git commit -m "(message)"
- Commit and add all changes to staging:

        git commit -am "(message)"
- Switch to a commit in the current branch:

        git checkout <commit>
- Show metadata and content changes of a commit:

        git show <commit>
- Discard all changes to a commit:

        git reset –hard <commit>
- Discard all local changes in the directory:

        git reset –hard Head
- Show the history of changes:

        git log
- Stash all modified files:

        git stash
- Retrieve stashed files:

        git stash pop
- Empty stash:

        git stash drop
- Define a tag:

        git tag (tag_name)
- Push changes to origin:

        git push

### Branching
- Display a list of all branches:

        git branch
- Make a new branch and switch to it:

        git checkout -b <branchname>
- Switch to a branch:

        git checkout <branchname>
- Delete a branch:

        git branch -d <branchname>

        git merge <branchname>
- Fetch a branch from the repository:

        git fetch remote <branchname>
- View merge conflicts between branches:

        git diff <sourcebranch> <targetbranch>
- Preview changes before merging branches:

        git diff <sourcebranch> <targetbranch>
- Push all local branches to a designated remote repository:

        git push –all
